	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps determine how efficient an algorithm is. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, allowing them to handle larger inputs more effectively.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that scales linearly with the size of the input.</p>
